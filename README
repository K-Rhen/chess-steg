This is a tool to encode/decode short messages as chess games.

Typically gets about 0.5 bytes per ply. (which is what we'd expect: 0.5 bytes = 4 bits, or 16 possible moves).

Too slow and unwieldy for large content, but I believe it technically has no limit on the amount of data
it can encode as it ignores draw by repetition and the 50 move rule. Perhaps it can break in some situation
where a player is left with playing a checkmate as his only legal move?
